# Godot HUB
Here's my take on an advanced version of Godot's standard project manager. With this Hub, you can manage all your different Godot projects from a single location. This includes projects made with different versions of Godot.

Once Godot versions are added, you can tell the Hub to use that version + build of Godot and it will remember to launch that project using that specific version + build. No more having to open/run different versions of Godot to make sure the project doesn't get changed.

Additionally, this Hub supports adding/tagging projects with software. When these projects are ran/launch, so will the software tagged with them.

## Note
There are certain features that are currently being worked on. Release builds will be added once a new build is felt stable enough to be used.

### Planned Features - From highest priority to lowest
- Editing added Godot versions within the Version tab.
- Tagging projects from the project tab.
- Template Support
  - You will be able to make additional templates that the Hub will use to generate new projects for you.
- Installing Godot versions directly in the Hub
- Cloning
- Theming
